Difference between JSON and JS:
- JSON is more simple than JS

--JS object:
const object {
    name: "Phuoc Huynh",
    age: 24,
    location: Olympia,
    education: [
        {
            school: "SPSCC",
            degree: "Associate in Arts",
        },
        {
            school: "Evergreen State College",
            degree: "Bachelor of Science in CS",
        },

    ]
};

--JSON:
{
    name: "Phuoc Huynh",
    age: 24,
    location: Olympia,
    education: [
        {
            school: "SPSCC",
            degree: "Associate in Arts",
        },
        {
            school: "Evergreen State College",
            degree: "Bachelor of Science in CS",
        },

    ]
}
